# HPO Pattern matches

These tables are automated automatically using the command:

```
sh run.sh make dosdp-matches-matches
```

They contain all the information of the EQs in tabular form. This serves multiple purposes:

1. Human review. HPO Curators can use these tables to ensure the correct patterns where use to describe the right phenotypic abnormalities
2. User reference. Users can use these tables to extract links from HPO to other ontologies. Note that these links can only really be understood in the context of a pattern, so some caution is advised.
