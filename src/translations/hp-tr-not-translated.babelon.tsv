In the second trimester, a true midsagittal view of the fetal profile is obtained and magnified to fill the majority of the image space. The nasal bone appears as an echogenic linear structure below the skin edge. The optimal angle of insonation is 45 degrees to the longitudinal axis of the fetal nasal bone. If the angle of insonation is 0 or 180 degrees, the nasal bone may appear artificially absent. The presence or absence of the nasal bone may be determined at the time of the 11- to 14-week ultrasound examination and used as part of the risk assessment for aneuploidy.

On cross-section, normal muscle appears as a relatively anechoic structure with hyperechoic speckles within the tissue representing perimysial septa, giving it a starry night appearance. The boundaries of each muscle are delineated by the presence of hyperechoic fascia. In muscle disorders, one of the hallmark findings is replacement of healthy muscle with fat and fibrosis, manifested by an increase in echogenicity from higher sound transitions in the muscle. This increase in echogenicity is most distinct in conditions that lead to chronic pathology, such as long-standing muscle inflammation, dystrophy, or denervation.

Comment: Pulmonary surfactant is a highly surface-active mixture of proteins and lipids that is synthesized and secreted onto the alveoli by type II epithelial cells. The protein part of surfactant constitutes of four types of surfactant proteins (SP), SP-A, SP-B, SP-C and SP-D. SP-A and SP-D are hydrophilic proteins that regulate surfactant metabolism and have immunologic functions, whereas SP-B and SP-C are hydrophobic molecules, which play a direct role in the organization of the surfactant structure in the interphase and in the stabilization of the lipid layers during the respiratory cycle. Lack of SP-C may result of surfactant metabolism dysfunction and is also observed in patients with other diffuse parenchymal lung diseases, pathogenetically related to the alveolar surfactant region.

Villitis of unknown etiology by definition excludes those cases where an etiology is identified, such as viral or acute infections, and thus is preferred to the term nonspecific chronic villitis. It is usually lymphohistiocytic: although the presence of rare plasma cells does not exclude the diagnosis, thorough evaluation for an infectious etiology, such as cytomegalovirus, is required in a predominantly plasma cell villitis.

Nerve conduction studies involve the application of a depolarising square wave electrical pulses to the skin over a peripheral nerve producing: (1) a propagated nerve action potential (NAP) recorded at a distant point over the same nerve: and (2) a compound muscle action potential (CMAP) arising from the activation of muscle fibres in a target muscle supplied by the nerve. In both cases these may be recorded with surface or needle electrodes. The CMAP is a summated voltage response from the individual muscle fibre action potentials. The shortest latency of the CMAP is the time from stimulus artefact to onset of the response and is a biphasic response with an initial upward deflection followed by a smaller downward deflection. The CMAP amplitude is measured from baseline to negative peak (the neurophysiological convention is that negative voltage is demonstrated by an upward deflection) and measured in millivolts (mV).

When a multilingual speaker has aphasia following a stroke, the languages spoken premorbidly may show comparable or differential patterns of impairment. Differential patterns may manifest as greater impairment in one language compared to another, or as differences in the characteristics of aphasia. Clinical reports of bilingual aphasia show dissociations in the processing of the language learned first (L1) and and second (L2), with one language more impaired than the other. Other cases show a pattern of differential recovery where L2 is recovered only after L1. Another pattern is alternating antagonism; i.e., patients access one language in spontaneous speech and inhibit the other language for alternating periods. This term should be used for a type of aphasia in a person who speaks multiple languages in which the impairment is different for different languages.	HP:0033849	IAO:0000115	tr		NOT_TRANSLATED

en	A rare, endocrine active tumor that causes severe renal phosphate wasting, which in turn can lead to critical osteomalacia. Phosphaturic mesenchymal tumors (PMTs) are typically small and mostly benign tumors producing fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23). FGF-23 lowers the expression of sodium/phosphate cotransporters, which are the primary transport proteins responsible for phosphate reabsorption in the kidneys. The paraneoplastic overproduction of FGF-23 lowers reabsorption of phosphate and causes severe paraneoplastic renal phosphate wasting and hypophosphatemia. FGF-23 also affects vitamin D levels by lowering 25-hydroxyvitamin D 1-alpha-hydroxylase in the proximal renal tubules and by increasing the expression of vitamin D 24-hydroxylase, a mitochondrial enzyme responsible for inactivating vitamin D metabolites.

This stellate scar is found in only 50% of all FNH nodules, but its presence is regarded as pathognomonic. The lesion itself is usually lighter in color than the tissue that surrounds it, and it sometimes has a yellowish hue.

Collagen VII is synthesized as three identical pro-alpha1(VII) polypeptide chains, which are hydroxylated and glycosylated in a coordinated manner and then fold into triple-helical procollagen VII in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Mature collagen VII undergoes a multistep fibril polymerization process to form the anchoring fibrils.

en	Cortical myoclonus mainly affects the distal upper limbs and face, which reflects the largest cortical representations of these body areas. It is often focal, but may be multifocal, bilateral or generalized, as a consequence of intracortical and transcallosal spreading of abnormal activity. It typically occurs on voluntary action and may affect speech and gait. Cortical myoclonic jerks are stimulus sensitive, typically to touch, but sensitivity to visual stimuli is also described. Most patients with cortical myoclonus have both positive myoclonus and NM, occurring either independently or together as a complex of the two kinds of myoclonus. If cortical myoclonus is prolonged and lasts for hours, days or weeks, it is called epilepsia partials continua and is considered to be a rare form of focal epileptic status. Focal cortical myoclonus almost always points to an underlining lesion of the sensori-motor cortex, which produces hyperexcitability (e.g. vascular, inflammatory or neoplastic).

en	Pronuclei formation is a critical process during fertilisation. Normally, there are two pronuclei (2PN), including the paternal pronucleus and the maternal pronucleus, in the zygote after fertilisation. It is generally accepted that multiple pronuclei (MPN) formation is due to the abnormal extrusion of the second polar body or to abnormal fertilisation with multiple sperm. The MPN therefore can cause infertility and recurrent failure of IVF/ICSI.	HP:4000008	IAO:0000115	tr		NOT_TRANSLATED

This term refers to the lack of visiblity of the CSP on prenatal sonography. The CSP normally can be visualized between 18 and 37 weeks of gestation. Lack of visualization of the CSP in this time period generally requires follow up and may indicate the presence of underlying malformations such as malformations of the corpus callosum. The lack of CSP before 18 weeks or after 37 weeks of gestation (or postnatally) is considered a normal finding.	HP:4000138	IAO:0000115	tr		NOT_TRANSLATED

However, a definitive diagnosis is often not made until postnatal life. The most common etiologies of fetal abdominal cysts are: ovarian, gastrointestinal cystic duplication, liver and choledochal, meconium pseudocysts, mesenteric and adrenal. Following identification of a cyst, careful morphological assessment allows the prediction of their natural history and importantly, the likelihood of surgical intervention being required postnatally.
