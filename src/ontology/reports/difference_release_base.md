----|----|
| Low tissue ferrochelatase activity (HP:6000697) | Concentration or activity of Ferrochelatase (FECH; EC 4.99.1.1) below the lower limit of normal. FECH enzyme can be measured in multiple tissues including leukocytes and cultured fibroblasts. FECH is the terminal enzyme of the heme biosynthetic pathway, and catalyzes the insertion of iron into protoporphyrin to form heme. |
| Elevated urinary bile acid level (HP:6000701) | The amount of bile acid in the urine, normalized for urine concentration, is above the upper limit of normal. |
| Reduced breast milk zinc concentration (HP:6000700) | The concentration of zink in breast milk is below the lower limit of normal. |
| Elevated circulating N-carbamyl-beta-aminoisobutyric acid concentration (HP:6000696) | The concentration of N-carbamyl-beta-aminoisobutyric acid in the blood circulation is above the upper limit of normal. |
| Elevated urinary glyoxylic acid level (HP:6000702) | The amount of glyoxylic acid in the urine, normalized for urine concentration, is above the upper limit of normal. The conjugate base of glyoxylic acid is known as glyoxylate. |
| Reduced tissue delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase activity (HP:6000695) | Concentration or activity of delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase (P5CDH; EC 1.5.1.12) below the lower limit of normal. P5CDH can be measured in multiple tissues including leukocytes and cultured fibroblasts. P5CDH is a mitochondrial matrix NAD(+)-dependent dehydrogenase which catalyzes the second step of the proline degradation pathway, converting pyrroline-5-carboxylate to glutamate. |
| Elevated circulating heptacarboxylporphyrin concentration (HP:6000698) | The concentration of heptacarboxylporphyrin in the blood circulation is above the upper limit of normal. |
| Elevated circulating 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid acid concentration (HP:6000694) | The concentration of delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate in the blood circulation is above the upper limit of normal. |
| Elevated circulating 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid concentration (HP:6000703) | The concentration of 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid in the blood circulation is above the upper limit of normal. |
| Elevated circulating CXCL9 concentration (HP:6000704) | The concentration of chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 9 in the blood circulation is above the upper limit of normal. |
| Aggravated by menstruation (HP:6000699) | Applied to a sign or symptom that is more severe during mensutruation. |
