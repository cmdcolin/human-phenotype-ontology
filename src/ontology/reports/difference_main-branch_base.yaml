  type II cells and myofibroblasts proliferate within the interstitium and airspaces.
  The corresponding clinical entity is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
  DAD may result from pulmonary drug toxicity, occurs in immunosuppressed, severe

old_value: Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) are an important cause of apparently
  treatment-resistant epilepsy and remain a major diagnostic challenge in epileptology.
  The two main PNES groups are panic disorder (also occurring as a reaction in people
  with epilepsy) and dissociative disorder (pseudoseizure), often developing inpatients
  with no history of epilepsy. The main markers distinguishing PNES from epileptic
  seizures are (i) the way the patient tells the story (not focusing on the seizure
  symptoms, avoidance of the word seizure, etc); (ii) that they are prolonged (many
  minutes); (iii) associated with hyperventilation and eyes closed; and that they
  present as treatment-resistant epilepsy despite an often normal intellect and brain
  imaging.
new_value: Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) are not abnormal perceptions
  or abnormal beliefs/judgments, nor are they epileptic attacks. They are behaviors
  that simulate epileptic attacks, not fully consciously.

  of frustration and manifested as whining and crying, screaming, kicking, hitting,

  usually happen between the ages of one to three years. Temper tantrums may be considered
  abnormal if they occur at an unusually high frequency, are of unusual severity,
  or occur at an old age than usual.
new_value: Temper tantrums are brief episodes of extreme, unpleasant, and sometimes
  aggressive behaviors in response to frustration or anger, which are a normal part
  of development in toddlers. Temper tantrums that occur more frequently in a given
  time and/or are more severe in symptomatology and/or longer in duration and/or inappropriate
  for the given age compared to a temper tantrum that naturally occurs as a part of
  the developmental process are classified as abnormal temper tantrums.

new_value: Subsarcolemmal, eosinophilic glass-like regions in the cytoplasm of muscle
  fibers. Hyaline bodies show significant reactivity to myofibrillar ATPase after
  acid pre-incubation and with immunohistochemistry, show intense reactivity with
  only slow myosin heavy chain. Electron microscopy of the affected areas show a lack
  of myofibrils and a uniform, finely granular matrix, sometimes suggesting a filamentous
  nature, containing few scattered nuclei and mitochondria.
