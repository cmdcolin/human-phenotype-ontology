old_value: Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) are an important cause of apparently
  treatment-resistant epilepsy and remain a major diagnostic challenge in epileptology.
  The two main PNES groups are panic disorder (also occurring as a reaction in people
  with epilepsy) and dissociative disorder (pseudoseizure), often developing inpatients
  with no history of epilepsy. The main markers distinguishing PNES from epileptic
  seizures are (i) the way the patient tells the story (not focusing on the seizure
  symptoms, avoidance of the word seizure, etc); (ii) that they are prolonged (many
  minutes); (iii) associated with hyperventilation and eyes closed; and that they
  present as treatment-resistant epilepsy despite an often normal intellect and brain
  imaging.
new_value: Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) are not abnormal perceptions
  or abnormal beliefs/judgments, nor are they epileptic attacks. They are behaviors
  that simulate epileptic attacks, not fully consciously.

new_value: The word hydrophobia has been used to describe the avoidance of drinking
  in the presence of hydrophobic spasms that can be observed in human rabies (described
  as a blockage in the throat with worsening of dyspnea). However, rarely, the same
  word has been used to describe panic reactions observed in a patient when offered
  a glass of water. This term does not refer to the latter meaning.

old_value: A temper tantrum is an emotional outburst usually triggered by a sense
  of frustration and manifested as whining and crying, screaming, kicking, hitting,
  and breath holding. Temper tantrums are normal in toddlers and young children and
  usually happen between the ages of one to three years. Temper tantrums may be considered
  abnormal if they occur at an unusually high frequency, are of unusual severity,
  or occur at an old age than usual.
new_value: Temper tantrums are brief episodes of extreme, unpleasant, and sometimes
  aggressive behaviors in response to frustration or anger, which are a normal part
  of development in toddlers. Temper tantrums that occur more frequently in a given
  time and/or are more severe in symptomatology and/or longer in duration and/or inappropriate
  for the given age compared to a temper tantrum that naturally occurs as a part of
  the developmental process are classified as abnormal temper tantrums.

old_value: A type of low sperm count where ejaculated semen contains less than 100,000
  spermatozoa per ml. With cryptozoospermia, the sperm count may fluctuate and a zero

  a second semen sample following centrifugation, the diagnosis of cryptozoospermia
  can be made (and azoospermia can be ruled out).

  the lung will appear normal at inspiration, but on exhalation, the diseased portions
  of the lung which have lost connective tissue recoil will remain lucent while the
  healthy portions of the lung will become more dense due to atelectasis. This helps
