----|----|----|
| Crypt hyperplasia (HP:0034588) | Crypt hyperplasia denotes elongation of the length of the crypts of Lieberkuhn, a process that initially precedes villous atrophy. Elongation may be caused by expansion of the lamina propria as a result of the proliferation of stromal cells, an influx of inflammatory cells and tissue remodeling. |                  Crypt hyperplasia denotes elongation of the length of the crypts of Lieberkuhn, a process that initially precedes villous atrophy. Elongation may be caused by expansion of the lamina propria as a result of the proliferation of stromal cells, an influx of inflammatory cells and tissue remodelling. |
| Psychogenic non-epileptic seizure (HP:0033052) | Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) are not abnormal perceptions or abnormal beliefs/judgments, nor are they epileptic attacks. They are behaviors that simulate epileptic attacks, not fully consciously. |                  Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) are an important cause of apparently treatment-resistant epilepsy and remain a major diagnostic challenge in epileptology. The two main PNES groups are panic disorder (also occurring as a reaction in people with epilepsy) and dissociative disorder (pseudoseizure), often developing inpatients with no history of epilepsy. The main markers distinguishing PNES from epileptic seizures are (i) the way the patient tells the story (not focusing on the seizure symptoms, avoidance of the word seizure, etc); (ii) that they are prolonged (many minutes); (iii) associated with hyperventilation and eyes closed; and that they present as treatment-resistant epilepsy despite an often normal intellect and brain imaging. |
| Early spermatogenesis maturation arrest (HP:0031039) | A type of spermatogenesis maturation arrest in which the block of developmental occurs in the spermatocyte stage. Testicular histology shows seminiferous tubules with Sertoli cells, spermatogonial cells and spermatocytes but no further differentiated cells like round spermatids. |                  A type of maturation arrest in which only spermatogonia or spermatocytes are found. |

| Neonatal bilateral symmetric myoclonic seizure (HP:0032836) | Neonatal bilateral symmetric myoclonic seizure is a type of neonatal electro-clinical motor seizure where the predominant motor feature is sudden, brief (<100 msec) involuntary single or multiple contraction of muscles or muscle groups of variable topography (axial, proximal limb, distal) that occurs at both sides of the body symmetrically. |                  Neonatal bilateral symmetric myoclonic seizure is a type of neonatal electro-clinical motor seizure where the predominant motor feature is sudden, brief (<100 msec) involuntary single or multiple contraction of muscles or muscle groups of variable topography (axial, proximal limb, distal) wich occurs at both sides of the body symmetrically. |

| Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (HP:0032202) | Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) is widely accepted as the precursor lesion of vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (VSCC). VSCC arises via either a human papilloma virus (HPV)-associated pathway, or more commonly, via a mechanism independent of HPV, often being linked to chronic inflammatory conditions such as lichen sclerosus (LS). Accordingly, two distinct subtypes of VIN are recognized: the HPV-associated high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion/usual VIN (HSIL/uVIN) and the non-HPV-associated differentiated VIN (dVIN). HSIL is clinically identified by its multifocal, warty appearance and on histology by conspicuous cytological and architectural atypia.

As a result, dVIN is rarely identified in advance of a diagnosis of invasive malignancy, despite being the precursor lesion of the majority of VSCC. |                  Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) is widely accepted as the precursor lesion of vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (VSCC).

In both cases these may be recorded with surface or needle electrodes. The CMAP is a summated voltage response from the individual muscle fiber action potentials. The shortest latency of the CMAP is the time from stimulus artifact to onset of the response and is a biphasic response with an initial upward deflection followed by a smaller downward deflection. The CMAP amplitude is measured from baseline to negative peak (the neurophysiological convention is that negative voltage is demonstrated by an upward deflection) and measured in millivolts (mV). |                  An abnormal finding in a compound motor action potential measurement in EMG.
