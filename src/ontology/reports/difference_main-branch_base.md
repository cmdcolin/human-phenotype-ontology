| Posterior predominant thick cortex pachygyria (HP:0020189) | Pachygyria with cortical thickness above 10 mm with and a posterior predominant severity gradient. The severity gradient is determined based on the gyral width, with gyri typically wider than 5mm over the more severely affected regions. Posterior predominant gradient indicates pachygyria more severe other the occipital lobes but also includes a rare perisylvian-predominant pachygyria and a temporal predominant pachygyria. |                  Pachygyria with cortical thickness above 10 mm with and a posterior predominant severety gradient.
